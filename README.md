# MailMind 

MailMind is a full-stack AI-powered email assistant built using React.js, Express, and OpenAI (or Hugging Face) APIs, designed to help users automatically organize, summarize, and respond to emails. It fetches emails securely via IMAP, applies NLP for prioritization and summarization, and provides intelligent draft suggestions for fast communication.

🔧 #Core Concepts
🧠 Prompting

We use carefully designed prompts to guide the AI model into generating relevant, context-aware summaries and email replies. The prompts dynamically include details from email threads to improve response quality.

📊 #Structured Output

The AI is guided to produce structured JSON responses (e.g., labels, priorities, summaries) using prompt templates and few-shot examples. This structured output makes it easier to categorize emails, generate summaries, and suggest actions inside the UI.

⚙️ #Function Calling

The AI can trigger backend functions for tasks like:

Fetching unread emails via IMAP

Summarizing long threads

Drafting reply suggestions

Assigning priority labels to new messages

Function definitions are included in prompts, allowing the model to decide when to call them.

🔍 #RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

MailMind can integrate a basic RAG pipeline:

Important emails or previous user replies are indexed locally.

Relevant email chunks are retrieved and injected into the prompt context.

This improves factual accuracy and keeps replies consistent with the user’s prior communication style.

⚙️ #Implementation Stack

Frontend: React.js with TailwindCSS

Backend: Express.js + Node.js

Database: MongoDB for storing preferences and labeled emails

AI Layer: OpenAI API (or Hugging Face Transformers) for NLP

Email Integration: IMAP for fetching emails, SMTP for sending replies

Authentication: OAuth 2.0 for Gmail/Outlook

✅ Evaluation Criteria
✔️ Correctness

Email categorization, summarization, and draft suggestions align with actual user intent and context.

⚡ Efficiency

Fetching emails, processing summaries, and generating replies are optimized to minimize latency and API cost.

📈 Scalability

The system is modular: frontend deployable on Vercel, backend on any Node-compatible host, and AI layer can be scaled horizontally.



Zero-shot prompting → Asking an AI to perform a task without giving any examples, only instructions.

Summarization Prompt:
“Summarize this email in two sentences. Email: Hi, your package has shipped. Expected delivery: Sept 1. Tracking ID: 12345.”
Output: “Package shipped. Delivery expected Sept 1.”

Triage Prompt:
“Label this email as urgent, personal, or newsletter. Email: Meeting moved to tomorrow 10 AM — please confirm ASAP.”
Output: Urgent

Reply Draft Prompt:
“Write a polite reply confirming Friday’s meeting. Email: Hi, can we meet Friday at 3 PM to discuss the project?”
Output: “Hi, Friday 3 PM works perfectly. Looking forward to it.”
